## Debugging the Shadow process

Shadow is currently built with debugging symbols in both debug and release
builds, though it may be easier to debug a debug build (generated by passing
the `--debug` flag to `setup build`).

Shadow can be run under GDB by prepending `gdb --args` to its command-line.
e.g.:

```
gdb --args shadow shadow.yaml
```

An alternative is to run Shadow with the `--gdb` flag, which will pause shadow
after startup and print its PID. You can then simply attach GDB to Shadow in a
new terminal and continue the experiment.

Example:

```
# terminal 1
# shadow will print its PID and pause
$ shadow --gdb shadow.yaml > shadow.log
** Starting Shadow
** Pausing with SIGTSTP to enable debugger attachment (pid 1234)

# terminal 2
$ gdb --pid=1234
> continue
```

### Troubleshooting

If when loading the shadow binary in gdb you see the error:

```text
Reading symbols from /my/binary...
Dwarf Error: DW_FORM_strx1 found in non-DWO CU [in module /my/binary]
(No debugging symbols found in /my/binary)
```

It's likely that the version of Rust that you're building Shadow with is
incompatible with your version of GDB. You can read more at
[Rust issue #98746][rust-98746].

## Debugging managed processes

A simulation's managed processes are implemented as native OS processes, with
their syscalls interposed by Shadow. Since they are native processes, many
normal tools for inspecting native processes can be used on those as well. e.g.
`top` will show how much CPU and memory they are using.

### Generating a core file

If a managed process is crashing, it is sometimes easiest to let the native
process to generate a core file, and then use GDB to inspect it afterwards.

```
# Enable core dumps.
ulimit -c unlimited

# Ensure core dumps are written to a file.
# e.g. this is sometimes needed in Ubuntu to override the default behavior of
# piping the core file to the system crash handler.
echo core | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern

# Run the simulation in which a process is crashing.
shadow shadow.yaml

# Tell gdb to inspect the core file. From within gdb you'll be able to
# inspect the state of the process when it was killed.
gdb <path-to-process-executable> <path-to-core-file>
```

### Attaching with GDB

You can attach GDB directly to the managed process. To make this easier you can
use the `--debug-hosts` option to pause Shadow after it launches each managed
process on the given hosts. Shadow will print the native process' PID before
stopping. For example, `--debug-hosts client,server` will pause Shadow after
launching any managed processees on hosts "client" and "server". This allows
you to attach GDB directly to those managed processes before resuming Shadow.

```
# terminal 1
$ shadow --debug-hosts client,server shadow.yaml > shadow.log
** Starting Shadow
** Pausing with SIGTSTP to enable debugger attachment to managed process 'server.nginx.1000' (pid 1234)
** If running Shadow under Bash, resume Shadow by pressing Ctrl-Z to background this task and then typing "fg".
** (If you wish to kill Shadow, type "kill %%" instead.)
** If running Shadow under GDB, resume Shadow by typing "signal SIGCONT".

# terminal 2
$ gdb --pid=1234
```

### Debugging with GDB

In managed processes, Shadow uses `SIGSYS` and `SIGSEGV` to intercept system
calls and some CPU instructions. By default, GDB stops every time these signals
are raised. In most cases you'll want to override this behavior to silently
continue executing instead:

```
(gdb) handle SIGSYS noprint
(gdb) handle SIGSEGV noprint
```

Once you have reached a point of interest, it's often useful to look at the
backtrace for the current stack:

```
(gdb) bt
```

In multi-threaded applications, you can get a backtrace for all stacks:

```
(gdb) thread apply all bt
```
